-- Links each usage row to its agent session (198_agent_sessions) so reports can filter requests
-- by project or session over any date-time range. NULL for traffic without an agent identity.
-- Kept as its own migration: the runner records a file as applied when an ALTER hits
-- "duplicate column name", which would otherwise roll back the agent_sessions table with it.
