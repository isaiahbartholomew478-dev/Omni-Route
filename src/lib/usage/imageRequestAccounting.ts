/**
 * Per-attempt accounting for the image routes (/v1/images/generations and
 * /v1/images/edits, direct and combo paths).
 *
 * Chat requests reach `usage_history` through chatCore; the image routes never
 * did, so per-key USD limits (`apiKeyUsageLimits`, which re-price
 * `usage_history`) and per-key usage reports ignored image calls, and the combo
 * and edit paths also wrote `call_logs` rows without the API key or the
 * selected connection.
 *
 * `runImageRequestWithAccounting` wraps ONE provider attempt:
 *  - binds the API key and the attempt's connection to every call log the
 *    provider handler writes (request-scoped, see callLogApiKeyContext);
 *  - on success, when the handler result carries the upstream `usage` object
 *    (OpenAI-compatible image APIs return one), writes one `usage_history` row
 *    attributed to the same key and connection, so the existing token
 *    extractors, pricing and per-key USD limits apply unchanged.
 *
 * Successful calls whose upstream reports no usage are deliberately NOT
 * written. Calls that report usage but have no pricing row are also skipped: a
 * zero-token row or a token row for an unpriced model would trip the fail-closed
 * budget guard (#12341) and lock a usage-limited key for the whole window, and
 * most image models ship without a token price. How to charge those calls
 * (per-image price, a cost column, or zero-cost rows) is left to a follow-up
 * decision.
